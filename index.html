                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>APJ Abdul Kalam</b>, widely known as the "Missile Man of India," was a renowned scientist
                    and former President of India. He earned this title for his significant contributions
                    to the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology in India. Kalam
                    played a crucial role in the development of India's first indigenous satellite launch
                    vehicle and ballistic missiles, including the Agni and Prithvi missiles. He was also
                    instrumental in India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998. Kalam's dedication to advancing
                    India's missile technology earned him widespread admiration and respect. He was awarded
                    the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, in 1997 for his outstanding achievements
                    in science and engineering. Kalam's visionary leadership and relentless pursuit of excellence
                    have left a lasting impact on India's defense capabilities and technological advancement.
                    He continues to inspire millions of people, especially the youth, to pursue careers in science
                    and technology.
